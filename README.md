# MadaFood
A food recipe finder web application written by html, css, javascript, nodeJS and PostgresQL. The application essentially includes a login/logout section for users to login/logout as local users / social login(facebook/google). A recipe database is created by PostgresQL to store all the backend data including users/ recipes/ comments/ ratings details. Users may choose to reset their password and profile ( the image is uploaded to online storage as a url and stored in database). Users may upload their own recipe and check in their profile. The application also provides recipes searching by name, ingredients and tags (list by filtering) using KnexJS both in food API/database. Whenever the user clicks the 'learn more' button for the recipe search by API. The recipe data will automatically be stored in our database for users' further actions.
